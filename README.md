This plugin provides syntax highlighting for [`mshell`](https://github.com/mitchpaulus/mshell),
an experimental concatenative shell.

## Installation

Most people will typically install plugins through a plugin manager,
such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

In the more recent versions of Vim/Neovim,
you can clone this repository directly to a location in the `packpath`:

```sh
# Vim
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/yourpackagename/start
git clone https://github.com/mitchpaulus/mshell-vim.git ~/.vim/pack/yourpackagename/start/mshell-vim
```
